# ImagePullBackoff

When a kubelet starts creating containers for a Pod using a container runtime, it might be possible the container is in Waiting state because of ImagePullBackOff.

The status ImagePullBackOff means that a container could not start because Kubernetes could not pull a container image for reasons such as 

- Invalid image name or 
- Pulling from a private registry without imagePullSecret. 

The BackOff part indicates that Kubernetes will keep trying to pull the image, with an increasing back-off delay.

Kubernetes raises the delay between each attempt until it reaches a compiled-in limit, which is 300 seconds (5 minutes).

# Invalid Image

`ImagePullBackoff` can be caused if the pod runs with an invalid image or typo in the image name or even a non-existent image.

Watch the demo on the youtube channel for practical understanding.

# Private Image

We will learn how to create a Pod that uses a Secret to pull an image from a private container image registry or repository. 

### Create a Secret by providing Docker credentials on the command line

```
kubectl create secret docker-registry demo --docker-server=<your-registry-server> --docker-username=<your-name> --docker-password=<your-pword> --docker-email=<your-email>
```

### Create a Secret by providing AWS ECR credentials on the command line

```
kubectl create secret docker-registry  \
  --docker-server=${AWS_ACCOUNT}.dkr.ecr.${AWS_REGION}.amazonaws.com \
  --docker-username=AWS \
  --docker-password=$(aws ecr get-login-password) \
  --namespace=default
```
